        <h3>What is WikiVice?</h3>
        WikiVice is a Rails-based app that shows a visualized edit history for Wikipedia's pages. It pulls from Wikipedia's own (fantastic) API. For each page, it gathers 500 of the past edits and 500 of the past edit authors to aggregate data and show things about the page's editsâ€” for example, how often the page is changed, who is editing the page, how many anonymous authors have contributed, and where those anonymous authors have come from.

        So why make WikiVice? All of this information is already readily available on Wikipedia. However, it's impossible to find all of this information in the same place, and it's really, really difficult to understand what's going on. We wanted to show an edit history for each page that makes sense. Scroll through each page to see graphs, maps, a timeline of recent edits, and links to past edit author's pages to see what other pages they're editing.
